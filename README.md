ISD Final Project Documents

**to view any code on github in your browser, you can use https://htmlpreview.github.io/ (sometimes it takes a few minutes for updates to be available)

-index.html is the html file for the main page <br>
-style.css is the css file for everything <br>
-login.html is the html file for the login page <br>
-javascript.js is for the javascript that we will need to use to handle events (button clicks, etc)<br><br>

you can add your code directly to these files

-isd.sql is our database <br>
-login.php is for connecting the database with login.html <br>
-register.php is for connecting the database with register.html <br>
